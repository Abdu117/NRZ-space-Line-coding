# NRZ-space-Line-coding
## Overview

NRZ (S) modulation is an enhanced version of the Non-Return to Zero (NRZ) signaling scheme, designed to address the limitations of conventional NRZ modulation in digital communication systems. This report focuses on the practical implementation of NRZ (S) modulation, including the encoding and decoding processes using both Proteus simulation and MATLAB software.

The encoding process involves generating the NRZ (S) signal using Proteus simulation and MATLAB software. Proteus offers a comprehensive platform for simulating and visualizing the encoded signal, enabling an evaluation of its quality and performance, and MATLAB. MATLAB provides powerful tools for signal processing and analysis, facilitating the decoding of the encoded signal. The readme outlines the step-by-step procedure for encoding the signal in Proteus and MATLAB.
